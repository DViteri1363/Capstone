United States is one of the most popular countries for tourist to visit. It hosts millions of people every year and it does not matter the season; it is always full of tourists. 
Whether it is New York or Los Angeles, these two cities are the most popular destinations for tourists all over the world. 
People often believe that these two states are the center of the ‘East Coast vs West Coast war’ to determine which one is the best place to be. 
They offer all the tourist attractions every city has, but what makes them outstand from other places is the different cultures that live there. 
These two states are the most culturally diverse among the U.S and this is why they are so special for tourists. 

The objective of this study is to use data science tools to help a tourist agency to determine a new travel package for their customers. 
Our job as data scientists is to give the agency multiple travel package options so they can sell them to their customers; these options will be presented by 
comparing New York and Los Angeles (what makes them different) and what different activities you can do in each city.
